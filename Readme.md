# SiaPeopleLearn
SiaPeopleLearn is an Educational platform powered by the Sia Renterd integration. It's a rebuild of our existing Dapp Mentors Academy system with seamless integration of Sia Renterd. This project aims to revolutionize our platform's storage system by transitioning to Sia's decentralized storage infrastructure, making it accessible to the Sia Ecosystem.
